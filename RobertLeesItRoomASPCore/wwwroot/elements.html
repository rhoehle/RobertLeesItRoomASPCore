          <h2>Back-End = The Brain</h2>
          <p>
            Many people refer to back-end development code as the brain of the
            application. It is never visible to the user. It is built with the
            use of server-side language and databases. This operation is a bit
            more complex. The developer builds an application which connects
            with a database to look up, save or change data and return it back
            to the user in the form of front-end code.

              <h4>Java</h4>
              <p>
                This is my personal favorite language. It is versatile and
                full-featured. It is everywhere. Java is a general-purpose
                computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based,
                object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few
                implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let
                application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),
                meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
                support Java without the need for recompilation. Java
                applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on
                any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer
                architecture. As of 2015, Java is one of the most popular
                programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web
                applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was
                originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which
                has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in
                1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The
                language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has
                fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

                <h4>IBM, CL, and RPG</h4>
                <p>
                  The IBM i Control Language (CL) is a scripting language for
                  the IBM's IBM i platform (previously called OS/400 when
                  running on AS/400 systems) bearing a resemblance to the IBM
                  Job Control Language and consisting of an ever expanding set
                  of command objects (*CMD) used to invoke traditional AS/400
                  programs and/or get help on what those programs do. CL can
                  also be used to create CL programs (congruent to shell
                  scripts) where there are additional commands that provide
                  program-like functionality (IF/ELSE, variable declaration,
                  file input, etc.)
                </p>
              </header>
              <p>
                RPG is a high-level programming language (HLL) for business
                applications. RPG is an IBM proprietary programming language and
                its later versions are only available on IBM i or OS/400 based
                systems. It has a long history, having been developed by IBM in
                1959 as the Report Program Generator - a tool to replicate
                punched card processing on the IBM 1401 then updated to RPG II
                for the IBM System/3 in the late 1960s, and since evolved into
                an HLL equivalent to COBOL and PL/I.

                <h5>OCL</h5>
                <p>
                  High-level language programs require OCL to be activated. OCL
                  is used to load programs into the system's memory and start
                  them (a process called execution) and assign resources such as
                  disk files, printers, message members, memory, and disk space
                  to those programs. Other abilities, such as displaying text on
                  the screen, pause messages, and so forth, make OCL more
                  powerful.

              <h5>The Computer</h5>
              <blockquote>
                A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to
                carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations
                automatically. Since a sequence of operations can be readily
                changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
